#Association relationship : uses-a relationship between two classes.-- 
# Aggregation is a special type of Association, where one class contains a reference to another class, but both can still exist independently.
#One class uses another, but ther are independent entities 
#There's no strong ownership - they just collaborate- The container object doesnâ€™t own the contained object.
