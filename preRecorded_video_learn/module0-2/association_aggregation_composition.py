# association vs aggregation vs composition
'''
--> Association is a general relationship where objects interact but can exist independently;
--> Aggregation is a type of association representing a "has-a" relationship where the contained object can exist independently (shared ownership); 
--> Composition is a strong "has-a" relationship where the contained object's lifecycle is tied to the container (no independent existence).

#Association relationship : uses-a relationship between two classes.-- 
# Aggregation is a special type of Association, where one class contains a reference to another class, but both can still exist independently.
#One class uses another, but ther are independent entities 
#There's no strong ownership - they just collaborate- The container object doesnâ€™t own the contained object.


#ðŸ‘‰ Here, Driver uses Car, but neither owns the other. If Driver is deleted, the Car still exists.
# class Driver:
#     def __init__(self,name):
#         self.name = name
#     def drive(self, car):
#         print(f'{self.name} is driving {car.brand}')
# class Car:
#     def  __init__(self, brand):
#         self.brand = brand
# car = Car('Toyota')
# driver = Driver('John')
# driver.drive(car)


#ðŸ‘‰ Department has employees, but employees can exist without the department.
# class Department:
#     def __init__(self, name):
#         self.name = name
#         self.employees = [] # aggregation
    
#     def add_employee(self, employee):
#         self.employees.append(employee)
# class Employee:
#     def __init__(self, name):
#         self.name = name
# e1 = Employee("Alice")
# e2 = Employee("Bob")
# dept = Department("IT")
# dept.add_employee(e1)
# dept.add_employee(e2)
# print([emp.name for emp in dept.employees]) #['Alice', 'Bob']

ðŸ”¹ Key Difference: Association vs Aggregation

| Feature           | Association | Aggregation                                              |
| ----------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Relationship Type | "Uses-a"    | "Has-a"                                                  |
| Ownership         | No          | Partial (weak)                                           |
| Lifespan          | Independent | Independent (department deletion wonâ€™t delete employees) |
