'''
ðŸ”Ž What is Scope Resolution in Python?
# Scope â†’ defines where a variable (or name) is accessible.
# Scope resolution â†’ the process Python uses to figure out which variable a name refers to when it is used.
# Python follows the LEGB Rule (Local â†’ Enclosed â†’ Global â†’ Built-in) to resolve variable names.
'''
# Local (L)
# Names inside the current function.

def func():
    x = 10   # local
    print(x) # resolves to local


# Enclosed (E)
# Names in outer functions (when functions are nested).

def outer():
    x = 20   # enclosed variable
    def inner():
        print(x)  # finds in enclosing scope
    inner()
outer()


# Global (G)
# Names defined at the top-level of the script/module.

x = 30   # global variable
def func():
    print(x)  # resolves to global variable
func()


# Built-in (B)
# Pythonâ€™s built-in names (like len, sum, print).

print(len("hello"))  # resolves to built-in len


x = 10              #Global variable
def func():
    x = 19             #local variable
    y = 20             #local variable
    print("x",x)
    print('y',y)

func()
print(x)
